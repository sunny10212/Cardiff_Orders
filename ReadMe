 Produce a bar plot that shows, for each year, the quantity sold for each
product. Your code should generate a similar visualization like the one below (but colours,
font size, etc can be different):
Q2.2 (visualization). Produce a correlation matrix and heatmap visualization between gbp
and qty values for soda, juice and wine. You can use seaborn. Your code should generate a
similar visualization like the one below (but colours, font size, etc can be different).
Q2.3 (answering questions). To answer the following questions, write Python code for
querying the dataframe you have loaded with read_csv():
• How many orders were placed in 2016?
• Which client has purchased the greatest number of soda bottles overall?
• In which weekday is wine sold the most on average (across the whole sales history)?
• Which drink was the most popular (in GBP) in winter (from Dec 21st to March 21st)?
Break your answer down for each year.
• In which year-month (e.g. January 2015) was there the highest number of orders in
which the quantity of wine bottles was higher than the average for that year?
